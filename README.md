# Team Editor in JavaFX
This project was to create a team editor in JavaFX where when a team object is edited, the change will be seen in all JavaFX windows associated with that team. The project would open a scoreboard window listing 5 empty teams. Once you click on one team, an editor window would pop up, where you could change the name and score of that team, as well as get a current time for the change. A user can click multiple times, which will bring up new editor windows. If one window is updated, then all open windows associated with that specific team will also get updated. 

## Team Object
The team object stored a name between 5 to 50 alpha numeric characters, a score between 0 and 2000, and a date modified.
